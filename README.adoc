Generate Clojure tests from AsciiDoc and CommonMark doc code blocks.

[CAUTION]
====
Example code in docs, while likely not malicious, could be illustrating, for example, how to wipe a drive. +
So, do be deliberate and careful about what docs you run through test-doc-blocks.

== Status

Initial concept. Currently being used to test doc blocks in rewrite-cljc.

* Alpha, this might not be a good general idea, but might work well for some projects.
* Feedback welcome.

== Rationale
I wanted to make sure the code examples I provided in rewrite-cljc documentation do not mislead and would function as expected for those who dared to try them.

Test-doc-blocks might (or might not, see link:#limitations[limitations], and link:#interesting-alternatives[interesting alternatives]) be of interest for your Clojure project too.

If your example code blocks are REPL style:

//#:test-doc-blocks{:skip false}
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (* 6 7)
42
----

Or editor style:

//#:test-doc-blocks{:skip false}
[source,clojure]
----
(* 6 7)
;; => 42
----

And don't rely on any special unspecified setup, then test-doc-blocks might work for your project too.

== Usage

Add an alias to your `deps.edn`:

// NOTE: mvn/version version is automatically updated by release process
[source,clojure]
----
    :gen-doc-tests {:extra-deps {lread/test-doc-blocks {:mvn/version "1.0.92-alpha"}}
                    :exec-fn lread.test-doc-blocks/gen-tests}
----

Then the most basic usage is:

[source,shell]
----
clojure -X:gen-doc-tests
----

This generates Clojure tests for code blocks in your `README.md` to the `target/test-doc-blocks/test` directory.
Any existing tests under `target/test-doc-blocks` will be replaced.

The generated tests have no dependency on test-doc-blocks and can be run with your preferred test runner.

Test-doc-blocks looks for assertions in your doc code blocks that are in editor style and REPL style format.
For example...

//#:test-doc-blocks{:skip false}
[source,clojure]
----
user=> (/ 714 17)
42
----

...generates the test assertion `(is (= 42 (/ 714 17)))`.
For more detailed examples and inline options, see:

* link:doc/example.adoc[AsciiDoc example]
* link:doc/example.md[CommonMark example]

The test-doc-blocks link:deps.edn[deps.edn] has some aliases that might server as useful examples:

* `:isolated/cljs-test-runner` - runs generated tests under ClojureScript using https://github.com/Olical/cljs-test-runner[cljs-test-runner] +
Invoke for this project via: `clj -M:isolated/cljs-test-runner`
* `:isolated/kaocha` - runs generated tests under Clojure using https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[kaocha] +
Invoke for this project via: `clj -M:isolated/kaoacha generated`. Note also kaocha link:tests.edn[tests.edn] config.
* `:isolated/clj-test-runner` - runs generated tests under Clojure using https://github.com/cognitect-labs/test-runner[Cognitect test-runner] +
Invoke for this project via: `clj -M:isolated/clj-test-runner`

=== Command Line Options

:docs::
The default file to generate tests for is README.md.
+
If you want to specify a different vector of files you can do so via `:docs`:
+
[source,shell]
----
clojure -X:gen-doc-tests :docs '["README.adoc" "doc/example.adoc" "doc/example.md"]'
----

:target-root::
The default directory to generate tests is `./target`.
+
You can override this via `:target-root`:
+
[source,shell]
----
clojure -X:gen-doc-tests :target-root '"./someplace/else"'
----
+
Note that test-doc-blocks will delete and recreate `test-docs-block/test` dirs under the target root.
Keep that the location mind when figuring out where to point your test runner.

:platform::
The platform governs what Clojure file types will be generated for tests.
+
Specify:

* `:clj` for Clojure, generates `.clj` files
* `:cljs` for ClojureScript, generates `.cljs` files
* `:cljc` for mixed, generates `.cljc` files

+
The default is `:cljc`.
Platform can be overridden for code blocks via inline options.

[#limitations]
== Limitations

Some current limitations that we might entertain addressing:

* If your code block depends on some external setup, we've no way to express that.
* Test-doc-blocks will automatically handle inline `(require ...)` and `(import ...)` appearing in code blocks, but not in any complex expressions of these forms.
* Parsing adoc and md files is on the naive side but should handle most common cases.
If we've overlooked a common syntax, let us know.

Some limitations we have no current plans to address:

* Code blocks using `ns` or `in-ns` will not work with test-doc-blocks.
* It is possible to embed HTML into your docs.
If your code or headings are expressed in embedded HTML within your doc, test-doc-blocks won't find them.

[#interesting-alternatives]
== Interesting Alternatives

Here are other options and related projects that I am currently aware of:

* https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha[kaocha] - Koacha supports running cucumber tests.
It uses this support in tests for its own documentation.
A `.feature` document describes the feature and includes given, when, then scenarios that are both run and shown in documentation.
Gritty details can be hidden in step definitions.
* https://github.com/seancorfield/readme[readme] - Generates tests for code blocks found in .md files and then runs them.
* https://github.com/liquidz/testdoc[testdoc] - Tests code blocks in docstrings and external docs.
* https://github.com/sogaiu/alc.x-as-tests[alc.x-as-tests] - Runs code in `(comment ...)` blocks as tests.

== Development

=== Prerequisites

In addition to the https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started[Clojure CLI], you will need to install https://github.com/borkdude/babashka[babashka] to run scripts.

The example ClojureScript test runner does make use of https://nodejs.org[Node.js]

=== Tests

==== Unit
[source,shell]
----
clojure -M:kaocha unit
----

==== Integration
Run integration test via:
[source,shell]
----
clojure -M:kaocha integration
----
This will generate tests for README and example docs and then diff against a previously manually verified test run.
The previously verified test run is stored under `test-resources/expected`.

On failure careful manual inspection is recommended.
When you are happy with current behaviour of generation of tests:

[source,shell]
----
bb script/gen_local_tests.clj regen-expected
----

==== Generated

Generate tests for local docs via:
[source,shell]
----
bb script/gen_local_tests.clj
----

Run generated tests under Clojure via:
[source,shell]
----
clojure -M:isolated/kaocha generated
----

And under ClojureScript via:
[source,shell]
----
clojure -M:isolated/cljs-test-runner
----

==== Continuous Integration

To run what CI runs:
[source,shell]
----
bb script/ci_tests.clj
----

=== Linting
We use clj-kondo to lint project source and fail the build when linting fails.

To run linting as the CI server does:

[source,shll]
----
bb script/lint.clj
----

== Versioning

rewrite-cljc versioning scheme is: `major`.`minor`.`patch`-`test-qualifier`

* `major` increments when the API has been broken - something, as a rule, we'd like to avoid.
* `minor` increments to convey significant new features have been added.
* `patch` indicates bug fixes - it is the number of commits in the repo.
* `test-qualifier` is absent for stable releases. Can be `alpha`, `beta`, `rc1`, etc.

The project maintainer manually manages `major` `minor` and `test-qualifier` in `version.edn`.

== Releasing

A release is triggered manually via a GitHub Action "Release" workflow.
A release can currently only be cut at main branch HEAD.

GitHub Actions prompts for the branch when running the Release workflow.
I've not found a way to disable this, just leave it set to `main`.

Our GitHub Actions "Release" workflow:

. Runs all tests.
. Calculates version (commit count will compensate for upcoming release commit) and applies to:
.. the `deps.edn` usage example in this doc
.. the "unreleased" headings in change log (new "unreleased heading also prepended")
.. `pom.xml` version and scm->tag
.. a newly built thin jar
. Deploys jar to clojars
. Commits updated docs and release tag back to repo
. Informs cljdoc of the new release
. Creates a release tag at HEAD

TIP: After a release don't forget to pull the changes made by the release workflow.

As a developer you can run the following locally:

* `bb script/release.clj validate` - to validate your change log is setup appropriately for release
* `bb script/release.clj prep` - to complete all steps up to, but not including, deploy, note that this will affect changes to `README.adoc`, `CHANGELOG.adoc` and `pom.xml`, you'll NOT want to commit these changes.
