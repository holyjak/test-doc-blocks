== Audience
You are involved in maintaining/releasing test-doc-blocks.

== Releasing
A release is triggered manually via a GitHub Action "Release" workflow.

=== Automated Workflow
The released workflow is handled by our https://github.com/lread/test-doc-blocks/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Release%22[Release] GitHub Action.

Our GitHub Actions "Release" workflow:

. Calculate a version using our versioning scheme and applies it to:
.. `deps.edn` usage example in the user guide
.. "unreleased" and "unreleased breaking changes" headings in the change log
.. ``pom.xml``'s `version` and `scm`->`tag`
. Create a thin jar
. Deploy the jar to clojars
. Commit and push updates made to `CHANGELOG.adoc`, `pom.xml` and `01-user-guide.adoc` back to the project
. Create and push a release tag back to the project repo
. Inform cljdoc of the new release

At this time, the release workflow does not run tests.
The assumption is that you've waited for the last CI test run to complete and are happy with the results.

The release workflow will fail if the change log is not ready for release.

=== Updating the Version

Edit `version.edn` in the project root.
The release workflow consults this file when constructing the version.

=== Special Setup

GitHub has been configured with necessary secrets for GitHub Actions to deploy to clojars.

=== Local Verification
To run the change log validation locally:

[source,shell]
----
bb ci-release validate
----

If you so wish, you can also locally run all steps up to, but not including, deploy via:

[source,shell]
----
bb release prep
----
Be aware though that you will NOT want to check in changes `prep` makes to `CHANGELOG.adoc`, `pom.xml` and `doc/01-user-guide.adoc`.

=== Invoking a Release
As a maintainer you should have sufficient privileges to see a "Run Workflow" dropdown button on the https://github.com/lread/test-doc-blocks/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Release%22[Release] action page.
The dropdown will prompt for a branch.
I did not see a way to disable this prompt, simply leave it at "main" and run the workflow.

TIP: Don't forget to pull after a release to get the changes made by the release workflow.
