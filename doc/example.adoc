:toc:

Test-doc-blocks will find Clojure source code blocks in your document and generate tests for them.

== The Basics

Assertions are automatically generated for:

* REPL session code blocks
+
[source,clojure]
----
;; test-doc-block will generate an assertion to verify (+ 1 2 3) evaluates to the expected 6
user=> (+ 1 2 3)
6
----

* Editor style code blocks currently offer more features:
+
[source,clojure]
----
;; test-doc-blocks will generate an assertion to verify (+ 1 2 3 4) evaluates to the expected 10
(+ 1 2 3 4)
;; => 10

;; it understands that Clojure and ClojureScript can evaluate differently
\C
;; =clj=> \C
;; =cljs=> "C"

;; and verifies, when asked, to check what was written to stdout
(println "is this right?\nor not?")
;; =stdout=>
;; is this right?
;; or not?

;; finish your stdout block with an empty or non-comment line
----

Test-doc-blocks will plunk your code blocks into a test even when there are no assertions.
It is sometimes just nice to know that your code snippit will run without exception.

[source,clojure]
----
(->> "here we are only checking that our code will run"
     reverse
     reverse
     (apply str))
----

== Inline Options
You can, to some limited extent, communicate your intent to test-doc-blocks.

Test-doc-blocks will look for Asciidoctor comments that begin with `:test-doc-blocks`.

It currently understands two options:

* `:test-block-opts/skip` - skips the next code block
* `:test-block-opts/test-ns` - specifies the test namespace for subsequent code blocks

=== Skipping Code Blocks

By default test-doc-blocks will create tests for all Clojure code blocks it finds.

Tell test-doc-blocks to skip the next Clojure code block via the following Asciidoctor comment:

[source,asciidoctor]
....
//:test-doc-blocks/skip
[source,clojure]
----
;; no tests will be generated for this code Clojure code block

(something we don't want to test)
----
....

=== Specifying Test Namespace

If you don't tell test-doc-blocks what namespace you want tests in, it will do its best to come up with one based on the document filename.
For this file, test-doc-blocks, up to this point has been generating tests to `example-adoc-test`.

If this does not work for you, you can override this default in via an Asciidoctor comment:

[source,asciidoctor]
....
//{:test-doc-blocks/test-ns example-adoc-new-ns-test}
[source,clojure]
----
;; this code block will generate tests under example-adoc-new-ns-test

user=> (* 2 4)
8
----
....

TIP: Do what you like, but test runners usually look for tests namespaces ending in `-test`.

The `:test-doc-blocks/test-ns` option applies to all subsequent code blocks in the document.

Changing the test-ns is useful for code blocks that need to be isolated.
Code blocks that require a unique set of namespaces fall under this category.

[source,asciidoctor]
....
//{:test-doc-blocks/test-ns example-adoc-new-ns.ns1-test}
[source,clojure]
----
;; this code block will generate tests under example-adoc-new-ns.ns1-test

(require '[clojure.string :as string])

(string/join ", " [1 2 3])
=> "1, 2, 3"
----
....

Section Titles
--------------
Test-doc-blocks will try to give each test block some context by including its filename, section title and starting line number.

It recognizes that Asciidoctor recognizes CommonMark style headers.
[source,markdown]
----
## this type of md header

And this level 1 type
=====================

And this level 2 type
---------------------
----

This code block should be include "Section Titles" as part of the context for its generated test.

[source,mardown]
....
```Clojure
(require '[clojure.string :as string])

(string/join "!" ["well" "how" "about" "that"])
;; => "well!how!about!that"
```
....

## Support for CommonMark Code BlockSyntax

Did you know Asciidoctor supports CommonMark syntax for section headings and code blocks?

Well it does! And test-doc-blocks recognizes this fact.

[source,markdown]
....
```Clojure
(require '[clojure.set :as set])

(set/map-invert {:a 1 :b 2})
;; => {1 :a 2 :b}
```
....
