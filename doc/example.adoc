:toc:

Test-doc-blocks will find Clojure source code blocks in your document and generate tests for them.

== The Basics

Assertions are automatically generated for:

* REPL session code blocks
+
[source,clojure]
----
;; test-doc-block will generate an assertion to verify (+ 1 2 3) evaluates to the expected 6
user=> (+ 1 2 3)
6
----

* Editor style code blocks currently offer more features:
+
[source,clojure]
----
;; test-doc-blocks will generate an assertion to verify (+ 1 2 3 4) evaluates to the expected 10
(+ 1 2 3 4)
;; => 10

;; it understands that Clojure and ClojureScript can evaluate differently
\C
;; =clj=> \C
;; =cljs=> "C"

;; and verifies, when asked, to check what was written to stdout
(println "hey there!")
;; stdout=> hey there!

;; multiple stdout lines can be verified like so (notice the single ;):
(println "is this right?\nor not?")
;; =stdout=>
; is this right?
; or not?

;; sometimes we might care about evaluated result, stderr and stdout
;; TODO: reader conditionals makes this example awkward
(do
  (println "To out I go")
  #?(:clj
     (binding [*out* *err*]
       (println "To err is human"))
     :cljs
     (binding [*print-fn* *print-err-fn*]
       (println "To err is human")))
  (* 9 9))
;; => 81
;; =stderr=> To err is human
;; =stdout=> To out I go
----

Test-doc-blocks will plunk your code blocks into a test even when there are no assertions.
It is sometimes just nice to know that your code snippit will run without exception.

[source,clojure]
----
(->> "here we are only checking that our code will run"
     reverse
     reverse
     (apply str))
----


== Inline Options
You can, to some limited extent, communicate your intent to test-doc-blocks.

Test-doc-blocks will look for Asciidoctor comments that begin with `:test-doc-blocks`.

It currently understands two options:

* `:test-block-opts/skip` - skips the next code block
* `:test-block-opts/test-ns` - specifies the test namespace for subsequent code blocks

=== Skipping Code Blocks

By default test-doc-blocks will create tests for all Clojure code blocks it finds.

Tell test-doc-blocks to skip the next Clojure code block via the following Asciidoctor comment:

[source,asciidoctor]
....
//:test-doc-blocks/skip
[source,clojure]
----
;; no tests will be generated for this code Clojure code block

(something we don't want to test)
----
....

=== Specifying Test Namespace

If you don't tell test-doc-blocks what namespace you want tests in, it will do its best to come up with one based on the document filename.
For this file, test-doc-blocks, up to this point has been generating tests to `example-adoc-test`.

If this does not work for you, you can override this default in via an Asciidoctor comment:

[source,asciidoctor]
....
//{:test-doc-blocks/test-ns example-adoc-new-ns-test}
[source,clojure]
----
;; this code block will generate tests under example-adoc-new-ns-test

user=> (* 2 4)
8
----
....

TIP: Do what you like, but test runners usually look for tests namespaces ending in `-test`.

The `:test-doc-blocks/test-ns` option applies to all subsequent code blocks in the document.

Changing the test-ns is useful for code blocks that need to be isolated.
Code blocks that require a unique set of namespaces fall under this category.

[source,asciidoctor]
....
//{:test-doc-blocks/test-ns example-adoc-new-ns.ns1-test}
[source,clojure]
----
;; this code block will generate tests under example-adoc-new-ns.ns1-test

(require '[clojure.string :as string])

(string/join ", " [1 2 3])
=> "1, 2, 3"
----
....

## Section Titles
Test-doc-blocks will try to give each test block some context by including its filename, section title and starting line number.

It recognizes that Asciidoctor recognizes CommonMark style single line headers.

[source,markdown]
----
## this type of md header
----

I think there is also support for 2 line headers but the rules might be a differ a bit from CommonMark.
As 2 line CommonMark headers in a Asciidoctor file should be rare, we'll not try to parse these variants in Asciidoctor docs for now:

[source,markdown]
----
And this level 1 type
=====================

And this level 2 type
---------------------
----

This code block should be include "Section Titles" as part of the context for its generated test.

[source,mardown]
....
```Clojure
(require '[clojure.string :as string])

(string/join "!" ["well" "how" "about" "that"])
;; => "well!how!about!that"
```
....

## Support for CommonMark Code Block Syntax

Did you know Asciidoctor supports CommonMark syntax for section headings and code blocks?

Well it does! And test-doc-blocks recognizes this fact.

[source,markdown]
....
```Clojure
(require '[clojure.set :as set])

(set/map-invert {:a 1 :b 2})
;; => {1 :a, 2 :b}
```
....

== Nuances

=== When Libraries Override pr

The REPL makes use of `pr` to output what it has evaluated.
The `pr` docstring states:

> By default, pr and prn print in a way that objects can be read by the reader

Some libraries break this contract.
For example, rewrite-clj overrides `pr` to display output for its nodes that is easily digestable by humans, but not at all digestable by Clojure.

If `pr` has been overriden for your library, you have choices for test-doc-blocks:

1. Skip the block (see inline options)
2. Avoid REPL assertions that effect the overriden pr
3. Have your code blocks include call `pr` on affected evaluations and use `=stdout=>` to compare for expected output.
